## The Project
Creating a web page to enhancement prospection captation of a short term location.
This will able to skip the plateforms fees as AirBNB or Booking.com (but able to book on it too) whith an intern system.

At the end, to avoid multi booking on the same date, I will integrate the Smoobu API to verify that two voyager can't book on the same date on my website.

There will have a comment section and a "around to disover" too.
